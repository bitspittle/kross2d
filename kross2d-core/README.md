This module contains code for a fully functionally, 2D game engine, as well as
JVM and web backends for them.

Most of the code that a user of this library will interact with can be found in
the `bitspittle.kross2d.engine` package.

This module also owns generally useful classes which, while used by the game
engine itself, are kept separate as users may also find uses for them in their
own projects as well. These can be found in the `bitspittle.kross2d.core`
package.
